Battleship
==========

This is a C implementation of the game Battleship. It is mainly to practice 2-dimensional arrays. The code is not perfect and redundant in some parts. But this is the best I could do at the time. 

This is an assignment for CptS 121 in Washington State University, Spring 2014. This code is mainly to help you get ideas on where to start. Please do not copy directly from the code as this is considered plagiarism.
